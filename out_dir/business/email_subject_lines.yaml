  ## Context:
  You are tasked with generating compelling email subject lines that effectively capture the attention of recipients for promotional campaigns and new product launches. 
  
  ## Instructions:

  2. Incorporate the following variables for customization:
     - {{product_name}}: Name of the product being launched or promoted
     - {{discount_percentage}}: Discount offered, if applicable
     - {{launch_date}}: Date of the product launch
  
  ## Format:
  - Use the following structure for each subject line: 
    "Exciting News: {{product_name}} Launching on {{launch_date}} with {{discount_percentage}} OFF!"
  - Ensure each subject line is engaging, clear, and encourages the recipient to open the email.
  
  ## Examples:
  1. "Don't Miss Out: {{product_name}} Launching on {{launch_date}} with {{discount_percentage}} OFF!"
  2. "Get Ready for {{product_name}}: Exclusive {{discount_percentage}} Discount Starting {{launch_date}}!"

  - Avoid using language that may be perceived as spammy or misleading.
  - Ensure inclusivity and avoid stereotypes in your suggestions.
  - Be mindful of cultural sensitivities when crafting subject lines.
