# Architecture Documentation

**Task Overview:**

You are tasked with generating comprehensive architecture documentation for the provided project source code. This documentation should be structured, detailed, and accessible, catering to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Documentation Requirements:

0 - Read the source code and understand the project architecture.

1. **Introduction**
   - Provide a brief overview of the project, including its purpose and target audience.
   - Present a high-level description of the overall system architecture, highlighting key features and benefits.

2. **System Components**
   - Identify and describe the main components of the system.
   - Explain the responsibilities and interactions of each component in a clear manner.
   - Include mermaid syntax-based diagrams to visually represent the components and their relationships.

3. **Data Flow**
   - Describe the flow of data through the system, detailing how data is ingested, processed, and output.
   - Identify input sources, processing stages, and output destinations.
   - Use mermaid syntax-based diagrams to illustrate the data flow effectively.

4. **API Documentation**
   - Document the available APIs, detailing endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
   - Provide clear examples of API usage to enhance understanding.

5. **Database Schema (if applicable)**
   - Describe the database schema used in the project, focusing on main entities and their attributes.
   - Highlight relationships between entities.
   - Use mermaid syntax-based entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to visualize the database schema.

6. **Deployment Architecture (if applicable)**
   - Explain the deployment setup, including infrastructure requirements and configurations.
   - Describe the deployment process step-by-step.
   - Use mermaid syntax-based diagrams to illustrate the deployment architecture.

7. **Scalability and Performance (if applicable)**
   - Discuss scalability considerations, including how the system can handle increased loads.
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks and suggest optimization strategies.

8. **Error Handling and Logging (if applicable)**
   - Describe the error handling mechanisms implemented in the system.
   - Explain how errors are logged and monitored, including log file locations and logging levels.

9. **Security Considerations (if applicable)**
   - Discuss the security measures implemented in the system, including authentication and authorization.
   - Identify potential security risks and outline mitigation strategies.

10. **Future Enhancements (if applicable)**
    - Suggest possible improvements or extensions to the system architecture.
    - Discuss how the architecture can be adapted to accommodate future requirements.

### Formatting Instructions:
- Use clear and concise language throughout the documentation.
- Incorporate mermaid syntax-based diagrams where appropriate to enhance clarity and visual understanding.
- Ensure the final document is formatted in **Markdown** and you use mermaid based diagram.
